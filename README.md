# Email
Sending an Email fast and easy! No need to open a browser and connect to your email.

After running the program, a Content Pane will appear. There you can insert the email of the recipient. If the mail is valid, then a new panel will appear. 

In the 2nd panel you will insert your Email & Password. You will also type the subject (not necessary) and the message of the mail.

After everything is filled, just click the 'Send' button and everything will go according to plan.
