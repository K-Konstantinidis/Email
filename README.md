# Email
A Java project, where you can send an Email.

This is a java project, in which you can send an email to someone else. When you run the Main method, 
a new Content Pane will appear. There you can insert the email of the recipient. If the mail is valid, then a new panel
will be shown to the user. There you will have to write your Email and Password to connect to, and then the mail message.
After you fill everything click the 'Send' button and the mail will be send to the recipient.
