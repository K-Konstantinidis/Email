# Email
A Java project, where you can send an Email.

This is a java project, in which you can send an email to someone else. When you run the Main method, 
a new Content Pane will appear. There you can insert the email of the recipient. If the mail is valid, then a new panel

After you fill everything click the 'Send' button and the mail will be send to the recipient.
